**Players will face the many (very unfair, but manageable with knowledge) challenges the City offers every day in either regular life, fixers' lives, or a syndicate members life, these challenges include: Surviving everyday life, Surviving the sweepers at night, staying on the good side of syndicates, and not attracting the attention of The Head.** 

**Level 3 (loredump üòÑ): \- ‚ÄúChildren  Of  The  City‚Äù  takes  place  in  the  Project  Moon  universe,  a  dystopian  world  where  people  live  in  a  massive,  dangerous  City,  which  is  composed   of  2  parts,  the  backstreets,  which  are  the  slums  of  the  city  where  street  gangs  and  less  than  fortunate  people  reside,  and  the  Wings,  which  are  areas  controlled  and  secured  by  their  respective  Corporation,  this  area  houses  those  with  average  luck  in  life,  fixer  offices,  and  the  Corporation  Offices.  The  City  itself  is  ruled  by  huge corporations,  each  given  a  letter  of  the  alphabet  and  a  wing  to  reside  in,  violent  gangs, called  syndicates, (the  main  5  being  given  the  name  of  a  finger)  and  secret  groups (known  as  The  Head, and The Library)  that  use  people  like  tools.  The  only  people  who  offer  ‚Äúprotection‚Äù  from  some  of  these  groups  are  known  as  fixers,  fixers  are  mercenaries  for hire  that  will  take  on  syndicates  and  every  day  tasks  for  the  right  amount  of  money, fixers  are  sorted  into  10  ‚Äúgrades‚Äù  9-1,  and  Color  Fixers,  Color  Fixers  are  given  a  title because  of  their  strength  and  rival  the  power  of  even  Abnormalities.  Strange  creatures called  Abnormalities  exist  here,  born  from  human  emotions  and  fears,  ordinary  fixers stand  no  chance  against  these  Abnormalities,  Abnormalities  usually  take  groups  of  strong  fixers  to  be  taken  down,  but  the  strongest  of  Abnormalities  are  handled  by  Color  Fixers,  if  a  person's  emotions  become  too  strong  for  them  to  handle,  they  can  undergo  what  is  called  ‚Äúdistortion‚Äù,  ‚Äúdistortion‚Äù  is  the  process  of  a  person  becoming  an  abnormality  due  to  the  overwhelming  strength  of  any  emotion ,if  a  person  is  strong  enough  they  can  tame  this  emotion  and awaken  their  ‚ÄúE.G.O‚Äù  which  is  a  manifestation  of  the  Abnormality  a  person  would  turn  into  in  the  form  of  a  weapon  and  armor.  The   stories  in  this  universe  focus  on  people  trying  to  survive  in  this  harsh  world  while dealing  with suffering,  greed,  and  the  search  for  meaning.  Each  playthrough  adds  more  pieces  to  the  story,  slowly  showing  how  the  City  works  and  why  it‚Äôs  so  cruel.**

**You, the protagonist, are a normal person in the City who just moved into a Wing. You can choose to remain a normal person, or become a fixer/syndicate member and climb the ranks trying to become strong enough to survive on your own in the cruel City.**

**Level 4:**  
**The protagonist is you\! Or whoever you choose for it to be, as a twine based text game the protagonist is basically a self insert.**  
**The antagonist, in a general sense, is the City, which is always against you and will always be unfair, in a more specific sense, if you‚Äôre a regular person, it's syndicats, gangs, and the head. If you‚Äôre a fixer, it's the syndicates, and The Library. If you‚Äôre a syndicate member, it's Fixers, the Head, and The Library.**

**Level 5: fans of the Project Moon game series would likely enjoy this game, playing as your own character in the Project Moon universe hasn't been something that's been done before so this game will be completely unique and offer a new experience.**  
**Level 6: what keeps the player playing? Every path (3 planned paths) will have tons of content and challenges to make sure the player doesn't exhaust all the content in just a few hours.**

**Level 7: The selling point of this game is that you can insert your own character into the Project moon universe.**

**Level 8: The inspiration for this game comes from the 3 Project Moon game titles, ‚ÄúLobotomy Corporation‚Äù ‚ÄúLibrary of Ruina‚Äù and ‚ÄúLimbus Company‚Äù. ‚ÄúChildren of The City‚Äù takes all of its lore from the Project Moon universe.**

**Competition: ‚ÄúLimbus Company‚Äù limbus company is the closest thing to this game since you (in lore) play as a specified character who makes choices and goes through a predetermined story to help your associates. ‚ÄúChildren of The City‚Äù takes a spin on this, turning your goals selfish (for survival) and letting who choose exactly who and what you are.**

**Level 9: I want players to feel like they‚Äôre really a person in the Project Moon universe, whether they want to be a weak and normal civilian, or work towards becoming a color fixer and taking on the strongest of enemies to protect others, the challenges the game offers and progression methods are how I will achieve this.**
